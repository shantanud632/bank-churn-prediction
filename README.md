# ðŸ“ˆ Customer Churn Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict customer churn in a bank dataset.  
We compare the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models using 5-Fold Cross-Validation.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models achieved an average cross-validation accuracy of ~85%-86%.
- **Feature Importance** showed that **Age**, **Estimated Salary**, and **Credit Score** were the top predictors for churn.
- **ROC Curve Analysis** highlighted that XGBoost delivered a strong AUC score.
